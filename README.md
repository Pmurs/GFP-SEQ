<h1>GFP-SEQ</h1>

This project is for the alignment and analysis of our **Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)** samples.

This project uses a split-GFP reporter system to validate integration and targeting specificity of DNA delivered via transposase or plasmid-based methods. 

We aim to identify **genomic integration sites**, characterize their **on- vs. off-target nature**, and distinguish between **transposase-mediated** and **random plasmid insertions**.

<h3>üî¨ Purpose</h3>

- **Determine where GFP integrates in the genome**
    - Record chromosomal location and frequency
    - Focus on **targeted integration sites** near known guide RNA regions (~1 kb window)
- **Quantify on-target vs off-target integration**
    - Create a ratio of integrations near expected loci vs elsewhere
    - Higher precision expected when using guide RNAs
    - Detect integration sites using **Long Term Repeat (LTR)**-based mapping

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Interpretation Caveats

- **GFP Sequence**
    - Should not appear in reads
    - We're sequencing genome-junction regions, not full transgene
- **Read count ‚â† Cell count**
    - PCR amplification and unknown cell input prevent using read counts to estimate number of cells
- **Multiple insertions**
    - Multiple insertions in the same genome can't be distinguished from separate cells
- **Off-target insertions**
    - Any insertions far from the expected target region (e.g. >1 kb) are considered off-target
- **Plasmid contamination**
    - Insertions containing plasmid backbone sequence are likely random/plasmid-driven events
    - High rates of plasmid integration may indicate protocol issues

---

### üß≠ Downstream Analysis Considerations

- Align reads to:
    - Human reference genome (hg38)
    - GFP reporter construct
    - Plasmid backbone sequence
- Classify insertions as:
    - **On-target** (near guide RNA)
    - **Off-target**
    - **Plasmid-based (non-transposase)**

<h2>Wetlab Context</h2>

<h3>üß¨ GFP Reporter Design</h3>

- N-GFP (G) and C-GFP (FP) are split GFP fragments
- Combined, they form full GFP only after successful transposition
- Artificial intron connects them in silico
- Acts as a reporter: only fluoresces if SB transposase integrates C-GFP into the genome with N-GFP

<h3>üß™ Integration Capture</h3>

1. gDNA digested with either:
   - AluI
   - FatI 
   > Restriction enzymes targeting LTR-adjacent sites
2. Self-ligation performed
3. LTR-sequence‚Äìprimed PCR amplifies the junction

<h3>üß´ Cell Line</h3>

- **Cells used**: 293T human cells
    - **Align to Hg38**
- **Integration mechanisms**:
    - **Transposase-mediated (canonical)**: inserts only the sequence **between LTRs** into the genome
    - **Plasmid integration (off-target/aberrant)**: occurs randomly, often includes plasmid backbone sequence
- **Electroporation delivery method**:
    - Plasmid and transposase mRNA introduced via electric pulse
    - DNA enters cells due to negative charge and membrane permeabilization
    - Cell uptakes transposase and manufactures it as a protein
    - Buffers and conditions optimized for ~80% cell survival
    - Electroporation preferred over lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for high-efficiency DNA delivery

<h3>üñ•Ô∏è Alignment Pipeline Summary</h3>

| Step | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. FastQC** | Runs quality control on raw FASTQ files using `fastqc` |
| **2. Filtlong** | Filters reads by length (100‚Äì1000 bp) |
| **3. Minimap2** | Aligns filtered reads to the **human genome (hg38)** |
| **4. Samtools** | Converts SAM to BAM, sorts, and indexes the alignments |
| **5. Medaka (optional)** | Performs consensus polishing and variant calling using filtered FASTQ reads and the reference genome |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Medaka requires the raw FASTQ input for consensus generation and internally realigns reads, so it does not use the BAM output from Minimap2. It can be GPU-accelerated for faster alignment
