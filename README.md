<h1>GFP-SEQ</h1>
This project is for the alignment and analysis of our Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) samples.

<h2>Wetlab Context</h2>

<h3>üß¨ GFP Reporter Design</h3>

N-GFP (G) and C-GFP (FP) are split GFP fragments

Combined, they form full GFP only after successful transposition

Artificial intron connects them in silico

Acts as a reporter: only fluoresces if SB transposase integrates C-GFP into the genome with N-GFP

<h3>üß™ Integration Capture</h3>

gDNA digested with either:

AluI or

FatI (restriction enzymes targeting LTR-adjacent sites)

Self-ligation performed

Then, LTR-sequence‚Äìprimed PCR amplifies the junction

<h3>üî¨ Purpose</h3>

Detect integration sites using LTR-based mapping

GFP sequence shouldn't appear in sequencing reads ‚Äî we're sequencing genome-junction regions, not full transgene

<h3>üñ•Ô∏è Alignment Pipeline Summary</h3>

| Step | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. FastQC** | Runs quality control on raw FASTQ files using `fastqc` |
| **2. Filtlong** | Filters reads by length (100‚Äì1000 bp) |
| **3. Minimap2** | Aligns filtered reads to the **human genome (hg38)** |
| **4. Samtools** | Converts SAM to BAM, sorts, and indexes the alignments |
| **5. Medaka (optional)** | Performs consensus polishing and variant calling using filtered FASTQ reads and the reference genome |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Medaka requires the raw FASTQ input for consensus generation and internally realigns reads, so it does not use the BAM output from Minimap2.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Create an Environment and Run the Pipeline

1. **Launch EC2 instance**
   - Use the `SMM-SEQ` launch template on AWS

2. **Download reference genomes**
    ```bash
    sudo bash SMM-SEQ/data/reference_setup.bash
    ```

3. **Configure SLURM job scheduler**
    ```bash
    sudo bash SMM-SEQ/data/slurm_setup.bash
    ```

4. **Clone the pipeline repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pmurs/GFP-SEQ.git
    ```

5. **Install dependencies and create Python virtual environment**
    ```bash
    sudo bash GFP-SEQ/setup.bash
    ```

6. **Run the alignment and variant calling pipeline**
    ```bash
    sudo bash GFP-SEQ/data/process_files.sh
    ```
